# Queue
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
# Enqueue
Enqueue function in a queue adds a new element in the queue. As a new element is added at the rear of a queue, so 'enqueue' adds a new node at the rear of the queue.
# Dequeue
Deqeue is opposite of enqueue. It returns and removes a node from the front of a queue.
